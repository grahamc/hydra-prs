* Initial Setup
** Provision an ARM (the Type-2A) server with your ssh key

takes about 10 minutes to setup

~ssh root@the-ip~

~uname -a~ showed me:

=Linux arm-gc.local.lan 4.4.0-38-generic #57-Ubuntu SMP Wed Sep 7
10:19:14 UTC 2016 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux=

** Pre-installation

1. Disable swap and format as ext4

Looking at =/etc/fstab= and then =ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid= I found my
swap was at =/dev/sda2=.

~swapoff /dev/sda2; mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2~

The =mkfs.ext4= should prompt about it being a swap filesystem, say
yes.

Mount =/dev/sda2= to /mnt

** Copy the system closure from the existing box (147.75.195.106) with rsync

#+BEGIN_SRC text
$ rsync -avz $(nix-store -qR --include-outputs  \
    $(readlink /run/booted-system)) root@<newbox>:/mnt/nix/store/~
$ rsync -avz /nix/var/ root@<newbox>:/mnt/nix/var
#+END_SRC

*** Failed Methods
**** ~nix-copy-closure~

~nix-copy-closure --to root@<newbox> /run/booted-system~

Target system doesn't have ~nix-store~

** Bootloader

Here is the sample from Dezgeg:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
menuentry "NixOS - Configuration 4 (2017-01-18 - 17.03pre-git)" {
search --set=drive1 --fs-uuid SDA2-UUID
search --set=drive2 --fs-uuid SDA2-UUID
  linux ($drive2)/nix/store/vj1wzzwxg3gwfl15kvsd62a41chnhq43-linux-4.9.4/Image.gz systemConfig=/nix/store/mv1pmjzvhfjlw1qn5062nj14h8xqci17-nixos-system-nixos-17.03pre-git init=/nix/store/mv1pmjzvhfjlw1qn5062nj14h8xqci17-nixos-system-nixos-17.03pre-git/init loglevel=4 cma=0M biosdevname=0 net.ifnames=0 console=ttyAMA0
  initrd ($drive2)/nix/store/69rnl7i62ss6hwn3pvqcgjmr57kzacnq-initrd/initrd
}
#+END_SRC

Change =SDA2-UUID= to the uuid of =/dev/sda2=, which can be found by
finding what links to =/dev/sda2= via ~ls -la /dev/disk/by-uuid~ and
place it directly before the ubuntu =menuitem=

Note that it is worth the time to verify that the paths in that
snippet exist under =/mnt=

** Reboot... and hope ;)

* Ok you're in NixOS now

Connect over the SOS console and you'll be automatically logged in.
